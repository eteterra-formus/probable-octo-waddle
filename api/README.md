# Page Tree API
This API returns a hardcoded list of pages as a structured tree.

simple API docs can be found by browsing the root.

please refer to the tests for more documentation about the API behaviours (configuration, routing, documentation)

the actual page tree itself has been separated from the API code, so we can extend it with additional logic later.
